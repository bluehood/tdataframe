        "description": "<p><code>TDataFrame</code> is a simple and yet powerful way to perform ROOT data analyses.\nIt provides great flexibility in the actions that can be performed inside the event-loop, expressed in a concise declarative syntax that fully encourages usage of modern C++. Transparent access to multi-thread parallelism makes <code>TDataFrame</code> a viable option for quick data explorations, as well as an expressive and high-level tool for more complex analyses.</p>\n<p>v1.0 comes with a satisfying first set of features, a user guide, Doxygen docs for the user interface and many ideas for future enhancements. A comprehensive suite of tests augmented by static analysis scans guarantees the stability of the software.</p>",
